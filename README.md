Audio Sync Tools
======================

## Aligner Using SMU Sphinx

In the folder `aligner`, you'll find code - all based on Weston Ruter's work - that attempts to download
SMU Sphinx, then do some work to sync files. The Gettysberg address file is the easist to work with.

## JavaScript Library

In the folder 'demo', you'll find the aligner code with several examples. The file `dream.html` aligns to inpage HTML, while
`esvbible-local.html` aligns to HTML loaded via AJAX.
